### Image Classification Challenge üçÉ
The objective of this challenge was to correctly classify images of leafs based on the species of the plant they belong.<br />
We developed three different solutions for this problem :
* Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
* Transfer Learning approach with Adam optimiser 
* Transfer Learning approach with SGD optimiser

Our best score was 0.9434 obtain with SGD and Adam.<br />

### Time-Series Forecasting Challenge ‚è±
The objective of this challenge was to forecast a composition of seven signals.<br />
We developed three different solutions for this problem :
* LSTM Network with Direct Forecating
* LSTM Network with Autoregressive Forecasting
* Transformer

Our best MSE was 3.78 with the Autoregressive LSTM Network.<br />

### Grade üéì
Total grade of both challenges : 10/11.<br />
